Keith and Janet Lane enjoy welcoming and
entertaining new friends aboard "LIBERTY",
and sharing the beauty of Southern New England.

Keith's career as a professional mariner began
with his enlistment in the U.S. Coast Guard in 1980. After attending CG engineering schools
and working as a member of USCG search
and rescue / law enforcement crews for a total
of 7 years, Keith retired from the Coast Guard.
Attending Wentworth Institute of Technology in the winter, and running yachts for charter
in the summers, Keith has been a working USCG licensed captain since 1985.

Janet's introduction into the yacht charter business started when she met Keith in 2000.
For many years, Janet worked in Boston as a corporate travel consultant. Working in
Boston and living on Cape Cod left little time for Janet to enjoy one of her passions ....
her love of entertaining, cooking, and preparing food.
